            <h1 class="title">Learn</h1>
            <p><span>How does Melodious work?</span></p>
            <p>The fundamentals are simple. There’s a graphic interface with a musical keyboard. Each key acts as a
              button, which triggers a pre-recorded sound.</p>

            <p>What is NOT simple is getting sounds to play in JavaScript. That’s where some proprietary technologies
              come
              in to play.</p>

            <p>The first is MIDI.js. Most people know of MIDI (Musical Instrumental Digital Interface) from plugging
              their
              synthesizers into a stereo receiver, or music-editing and engineering software like Pro-Tools and Garage
              Band. Those instrument-to-receiver connections usually come in a template of 16 in/out connections. MIDI
              allows a user to play multiple instrumental sounds from a single controller, like a keyboard, or drum pad.
            </p>

            <p>You switch the instrument on your Casio to “Glockenspiel” and voila! Your digital keyboard turns into a
              glockenspiel! </p>

            <p><span>MIDI.js</span> is a virtual coded version of those hardline digital music connections. It has
              channels that act
              like your typical bass-guitar hook-ups, transmitting digital sound files from the database, through to the
              user interface. </p>

            <p>In melodious, we have a database of custom musical sounds that we have connected to the keyboard
              asynchronously, meaning – you won’t hear the sounds until you press on the keys. It also means that when
              you
              want to learn a melody, we not only have to program the keys in sequence, we also have to parse the given
              melody into melody increments. </p>

            <p><span>Datatypes:</span> We use .mp3 music files. But…, PROBLEM! JavaScript does not understand .mp3
              files. It can’t
              read
              them, and it can’t play them. So, what music files does JS understand?</p>

            <p>Music files in JavaScript must be converted to Base64 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files to be read
              and played. </p>

            <p><span>Base64</span> is a binary encoded scheme that is computer readable. The document you are currently
              reading is
              “human readable”. All the coding languages that we have created are also “human readable.” But everything
              that we understand as humans must be compiled into “computer readable” formats. That format is typically
              binary (ones and zeros…, you know…).</p>

            <p>Most of the time, this human to computer translation goes unnoticed. For example, when you go on the
              internet and type in a web address to the browser (ex. www.amazon.com), the internet won’t understand what
              you wrote. So, it sends the request to a DNS (Domain Name Server) which translates your request to an IP
              address (Internet Protocol), so your human readable request becomes a number sequence that looks something
              like this: 157.240.3.35 (this is facebook’s web address. Go ahead! Try it in your browser!)</p>

            <p>In the same way, melodious must translate these .mp3 files to computer readable base64 encoded data.</p>

            <p><span>So, how does it work?</span></p>

            <p>Each note of a melody must be separated into an individual .mp3 file. This is rough work. For example, a
              simple song like, “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas” will have over 170 individual .mp3 files, each
              file to represent one note. We do this with standard sound editing software. </p>

            <p>Next, we save the sound files in our code editor and convert the sound data using a custom program which
              loops through all the sound files, one at a time, converts them to Base64 objects, and saves them in a
              JSON
              file. </p>

            <p>And these JSON files are not your typical custom APIs! Each object within the file, which may only
              represent two seconds of music, looks like a thousand lines of code… Huge!</p>

            <p>We then create a custom MIDI.js channel for each melody, and prepare options/buttons/dropdowns, etc. in
              the
              user interface to select the melody and load the data. From there, it takes some asynchronous terms to
              wait
              for the user to press a key before the code executes. And, voila! We have music!</p>

            <p><span>The Canvas</span> is provided to us by our friends at Sketch.IO who have just released their
              Sketchpad
              application
              on the App Store! You can find it <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1562886727">here.</a></p>

            <p>The sketch canvas, once loaded, can be manipulated, and configured with roughly the same Document Object
              Model type syntax terminal commands as vanilla JavaScript. </p>

            <p>DOM example: `document.body.style.background = "#FFFFFF”`</p>

            <p>Sketch example: `sketch.doc.setBackground(‘white’)`</p>

            <p>This is a great feature of Sketch.IO which made sandboxing and QA testing easy and a lot of fun.
              Sketch.IO’s documentation is relatively easy to follow and can be found here.</p>

            <p><span>Free Play:</span> Sketch has a library of fun clip art, as well as shapes and drawing tools. We
              decided, as a
              proof of concept, to use Sketch.IO’s shapes library. Our objective in the free play mode was to have
              shapes
              fall in random orders and places, as though novelty rain was falling through the canvas window. Let us
              know
              if you’d like to see some other interesting shapes or a different appearance to them.</p>

            <p><span>Learn Melody:</span> In this mode, the keys of the keyboard will light up in the order of the
              melody tones. The
              user clicks them in succession. If they click the wrong key, an error message appears. Melodious uses the
              Sketch canvas to scroll the words of the selected melody in the order and speed at which the user presses
              the keys. Press the keys to quickly, and the words overlap. ‘Too slowly, and the syllable falls off the
              canvas before it connects to the next syllable. </p>

            <p><span>Canvas scrolling</span>, or the movement of the words across the screen is nothing more than good
              old-fashioned
              looping on the x axis, at a rate that is commonly readable and matches the duration of each pitch, of
              course.</p>

            <p><span>The fonts</span>, however, come from the Sketch library, of which they have over four hundred!
              Though there are
              many choices, we’ve learned that scripts work better for scrolling. Current font = Pacifico.</p>

            <p><span>Custom Melodies</span> are welcome. Want to have your own melody played? Check out our Create page
